# useBreakpoint

The `useBreakpoint` hook is a custom React hook that provides information about the current breakpoint based on the
window width and allows you to check if a given breakpoint is smaller than the current one.

## Usage

```jsx
import { useBreakpoint } from '@0xforkitall/ui-kit';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const { breakpoint, isDown } = useBreakpoint();

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Current breakpoint: {breakpoint}</p>
            <p>Is small breakpoint down? {isDown('sm') ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
        </div>
    );
};
```

## Parameters

This hook does not take any parameters.

## Return Value

The `useBreakpoint` hook returns an object with the following properties:

### `breakpoint` (string)

The current breakpoint represented as a CSS custom property.

### `isDown` (function)

A function that takes a `breakpoint` parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the provided breakpoint is
smaller than the current breakpoint.

## Notes

-   The `useBreakpoint` hook sets up a resize event listener on the window to monitor changes in the viewport width and
    updates the breakpoint accordingly.
-   It's important to ensure that the hook is used within components that are mounted in the DOM, as it relies on the
    window's resize event.
