# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are predefined screen width values that define the responsive behavior of the UI at different screen sizes.
They allow for consistent styling adjustments based on the user's device or viewport dimensions.

The UI Kit defines the following breakpoints:

-   **Extra Extra Large (XXL):** Screen width from 1441px onwards.
-   **Extra Large (XL):** Screen width from 1200px to 1440px.
-   **Large (LG):** Screen width from 1025px to 1200px.
-   **Medium (MD):** Screen width from 769px to 1024px.
-   **Small (SM):** Screen width from 441px to 768px.
-   **Extra Small (XS):** Screen width from 0px to 440px.

These breakpoints provide a structured way to adjust layout, typography, and other design elements to ensure optimal
readability and usability across various devices and screen sizes.

The `$forkitall-breakpoint-list` map is ordered from the highest breakpoint to the lowest, enabling correct media query
prioritization when iterating through the list for responsive styling. You can use these breakpoint values in your Sass
styles to create responsive designs that adapt gracefully to different screens.

## Usage Examples

### Media Queries

You can use the defined breakpoints to create media queries in your stylesheets. For instance, here's how you might
use the breakpoints to adjust a component's style based on different screen sizes:

```scss
@use '@0xforkitall/ui-kit/src/styles/breakpoints/breakpoints';

.my-component {
    width: 100%;

    @media screen and (max-width: breakpoints.$forkitall-breakpoint-md) {
        width: 50%;
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: breakpoints.$forkitall-breakpoint-sm) {
        width: 100%;
    }
}
```

### React Usage

Use the [useBreakpoint](../?path=/docs/ui-kit-hooks-usebreakpoint--docs) hook for a programmatic way to manage and
react to breakpoints within your components.
